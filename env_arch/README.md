# Arch Linux Setup

This directory contains instructions how to set up Arch Linux
for using dd-curses to write USB sticks. We use this particular setup
with MEB USB copying machines.

You may want to use Arch instead of Debian/Ubuntu as it offers the latest
kernel which results better USB performance.
